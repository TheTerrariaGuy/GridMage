# Validation guide

## Requirements

Use the project's Unity 6000.6 editor and Windows graphics configuration for GPU checks. The geometry shader needs the graphics device; do not use a headless no-graphics invocation for rendering assertions.

Wait for compilation to finish and inspect Console errors before running suites. Run GPU suites sequentially: they temporarily control camera and shader-global state.

The core and rendering suites are editor checks, not NUnit tests, so a Unity Test Runner discovery command alone does not execute them.

| Tests/StoneTileLayout project | .NET CLI | 256 neighborhoods per element, shapes, family/stage separation, boundaries | Console PASS |

## Running editor suites

Use Tools > Grid Mage for the validation menu items, or execute the following method bodies using MCP execute_code:

```csharp
RefactoringChecks.Run();
```

```csharp
WorldRenderingChecks.Run();
```

For GPU suites, start one and wait for its Results.txt to report PASS or FAIL before starting the next:

```csharp
ParticlePixelationChecks.Run();
// After completion:
CastableOutlineChecks.Run();
```

CheckSupport.Runner handles editor iteration, final result reporting, and iterator disposal. WorldRenderingChecks has a separate reload-aware runner because it crosses the Play Mode boundary.

## Runtime fixtures

WorldRenderingChecks builds its fixture automatically. For the Blink scripts and outline lifecycle check, first execute in Edit Mode:

```csharp
ValidationFixture.Open();
```

Then enter Play Mode and evaluate the appropriate file through the Unity Pipeline or MCP:

```powershell
unity command eval_file --file Tests/Blink/Castable.cs --json
```

Stop Play Mode after each scenario to discard its board changes and restore the original scene. Open another fixture for the next scenario. For animation checks, wait for the result file before stopping.

ValidationFixture clones the scene as one hierarchy so references between its roots are remapped. Its board is 20 by 20 with the player at (5,5). It disables authored level artwork/markers and uses the rectangular fallback. Rendering settings, sprites, actors, and particle catalogs come from the actual gameplay wiring.

The fixture rejects unsaved scene edits before opening. It never saves its generated scene over the gameplay scene. If a setup failure interrupts a manual run, execute ValidationFixture.Restore.

Elevation and tilemap runtime scripts instead need an assigned TilemapLevel. Open Assets/Scenes/In Game.unity before their fresh Play sessions. They paint temporary runtime maps and must also be discarded by stopping Play.

## Standalone shape checks

```powershell
dotnet run --project Tests/StoneTileLayout/StoneTileLayout.Checks.csproj
```

This project links the actual TileSpriteLayout, GridMath, and ElementState sources. It does not duplicate their implementations.

## Baseline provenance

Tests/Refactoring/CombatBaseline.json was captured before the refactor from commit e38d584 using seed 71621.

Each of 160 cases contains a 12-by-12 input, existence/elevation arrays, expected output after each phase, and the surviving visual events with their owned cells. Cases combine all current element stages, missing cells, and height discontinuities.

The baseline tests compare every cell in every phase and every surviving visual event. Do not update the baseline merely to make a changed resolver pass. A deliberate gameplay change needs independent review of expected results.

Additional tests use explicit examples and malformed inputs. These cover behaviors that snapshot comparisons alone would not explain.

## Diagnosing failures

- Compilation failure: fix Console errors before running tools against new types.
- Missing effect: compare active V/decay IDs with ParticleCatalog.
- Sprite catalog failure: inspect duplicate keys, null references, and isolated previews.
- Board mismatch: the result identifies the baseline case and phase. Compare that snapshot before looking at presentation.
- Visual mismatch with matching boards: inspect priority/insertion ordering and ownership removal.
- Spawn occupancy mismatch: check that the enemy is registered, active and enabled, and that its world position maps to the expected tile.
- GPU mismatch: inspect captured PNGs, active rendering settings, and material import errors.
- Fixture failure: stop Play if needed, call Restore, inspect the exception, and do not save temporary test changes.

Current implementation-session results are recorded in Verification.md.
