# Stone sprite map

Assign sprites in the scene's TextureHandler spriteMap. Keys are `tile type * 100 + variant`; gameplay IDs are unchanged. All stone entries are linked to RockWall sprites for both types. Types 400 and 401 connect to each other. Lava (410/411), empty cells, and cells outside the grid do not connect.

`40000` / `40100` remain the default surface. Clearing a shape entry uses its corresponding default. Shape entries take priority over these defaults.

## Surface shapes

Rows below are mini 3-by-3 neighborhoods, read top to bottom (north to south), with `/` separating rows. `@` is this tile, `#` is connected stone, `.` is an empty/non-stone neighbor, and `?` is a diagonal that does not affect this shape. A diagonal matters only when both adjacent cardinal neighbors are stone. This yields 47 distinct shapes, including thin L/T/cross connections, filled corners, inner corners, edges, and solid interiors.

These IDs describe topology, **not the numeric suffixes of RockWall sprite names**. Pick the artwork matching each neighborhood. The RockWall sheet includes its own south-facing rock faces. The scene uses Wall Height = 0 to display those tiles without a vertical offset. Separate wall-front renderers and sprite slots are no longer used.

Changing a cell refreshes it and all eight neighbors, including diagonal corners. Repeated combat updates select shapes from the current gameplay grid, not partially updated Tile components.
